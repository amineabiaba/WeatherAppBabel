# WeatherAppBabel

**- Introducing the Application:**

- The objective of this project is to create a weather application for IOS device

that allows to see the daily or weekly weather in cities that we can add, edit, search and delete.

**- Application UI:**

- For the user interface of the application, I used SwiftUI, this framework is known for its simplicity and efficiency.
- The mechanisms provided by this framework are very soft and interactive, which made the programing very reactive and offred more ease in creating the app interface.
- It provides live preview, the results of the code are shown in real time without any need to build, so there is no need to an interface builder in Swift UI which was replaced by canevas, canevas make visual presentation elements appear while writing the code which is really interactive.
